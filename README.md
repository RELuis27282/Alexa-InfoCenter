# Alexa---WeatherCenter
My learn as I go project for Alexa Skills Kit and Python. This skill was inspired by https://github.com/Pizzaface/alexa-humidity

Currently, it gets weather conditions from Yahoo https://developer.yahoo.com/yql/console/#h=desc+weather.forecast, moon info from http://www.burningsoul.in/apis/moon, surf conditions from http://feeds.feedburner.com/surfline-rss-surf-report-south-los-angeles, earthquake info from http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/4.5_day.atom

The woeid for the Yahoo Weather API, is set to my location, so you will need to change it for your location. You can find your woeid here: http://woeid.rosselliot.co.nz/

Warning: I'm a newbie to Alexa Skills Kit and Python, so the code will be sloppy, bug infested and perhaps cause your Echo to self-destruct... :)
